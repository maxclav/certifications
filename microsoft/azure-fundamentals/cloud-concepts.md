## Cloud Computing

### Define cloud computing

Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change. ([Azure documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-cloud-computing/))

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically uses a "pay as you go" model, which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for users. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing))

Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing resources (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence) over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Cloud computing providers offer these services on-demand, like electricity from a power grid, and users only pay for what they use. These services can be divided into three main categories: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). ([ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)).

### Describe the shared responsibility model

### Define the Public Cloud Model

Link: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-public-cloud/

Public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources, like servers and storage, over the Internet. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud. With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these services and manage your account using a web browser.

### Define the Private Cloud Model

Link: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-private-cloud/

A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.

### Define the Hybrid CLoud Model

Link: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/

Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, more deployment options, and helps optimize your existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.

## Benefits of using cloud services

1. **Cost**: Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.
2. **Speed**: Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.
3. **Global scale**: The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when they’re needed, and from the right geographic location.
4. **Productivity**: On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.
5. **Performance**: On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.
6. **Reliability**: Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.
7. **Security**: Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.

## Cloud Service Types

Most cloud computing services fall into four broad categories: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), serverless, and software as a service (SaaS). These are sometimes called the cloud computing "stack" because they build on top of one another. Knowing what they are and how they’re different makes it easier to accomplish your business goals.

### Describe infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

Link: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-iaas/

The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.

### Describe platform as a service (PaaS)

Link: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-paas/>

Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.

Use case: TODO

### Describe software as a service (SaaS)

Link: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas/>

Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.
